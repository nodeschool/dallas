## Tonight's featured workshopper
Tonight's workshopper is lead by special guest host [Jay Henderson](https://twitter.com/blujconcepts) from the [NodebotsDFW](http://www.meetup.com/nodebotsdfw/) meetup ([NodebotsDFW twitter](https://twitter.com/nodebotsdfwÂ)).
- [nodebots](https://github.com/tableflip/nodebot-workshop) - Uses the [johnny-five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) is a library for working with Arduino and other rapid prototyping boards.  **No hardware required**. Arduino code is stubbed out, but if you have an Arduino you can plug it in and it will work.
