## What is Nodeschool?

<a target="_blank" href="http://nodeschool.io/">NodeSchool</a> is an
open source project run by volunteers with two goals: to create high
quality programming curriculum and to host community learning events.
NodeSchool meets across the globe at local meetups called
<a target="_blank" href="http://nodeschool.io/chapters.html">chapters</a>.
You'll learn about various node and javascript concepts, tools, and
libraries via hands on excercises called
<a target="_blank" href="http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers">workshoppers</a>.
he Core workshoppers will ramp you up if you have no prior experience
and teach you a thing or two if you do. From there, you'll be able to
jump into any of the growing list of Elective workshoppers and go deep
into specific topics.

## Bring your laptop!

Workshoppers are hands on which means you'll need to bring a laptop or
similar.

## What if I'm...

### a) new to Node, javascript, etc.?

Newcombers are welcome! The [organizers]({{ site.baseurl }}/organizers/)
and your fellow NodeSchoolers will happily assist you every step of the
way. Besides, NodeSchool is a great place to get started! And there will
be other newbies there if you (collectively) decide to come! We're all
newbs anyway :)

### b) an expert with Node?

First, re-read the paragraph above. Recall the days you were getting started
and what they were like. Imagine what it would have been like if your
current, experienced self humbly tutored your newb self. How would your
tutelage have made your newb self feel? How do you feel?

Now take a moment to reflect on the last sentance that generalizes we are all
newbs. List all the things you have learned that make up your experience.
Congratulate yourself for putting in the effort that has lead to your success
today. Imagine helping someone else take their first step toward success.
List all the things you have yet to learn. Let the length of that list sink
in. Think of what you can learn by teaching others. You should come, we're
all newbs.

## I'm in!

The Dallas chapter meets on the __4th Wednesday__ of the month at
__6:30pm__ (most of the time). Each event will have a featured
workshopper, but feel free to attend and work on any workshopper that
interests you. Take a gander at the upcoming events below to find out
when and where the next one will be. Please RSVP on
<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.data.urls.meetup }}">meetup</a> if you
plan on attending. See you there! (Bring your laptop!)
