## Hosting a Nodeschool Dallas meetup

**_This is a ROUGH DRAFT and subject to refinement_**

This is an extension of the Nodeschool organizational guidelines to hosting an event, a portion of which is highlighted below.

From the [Nodeschool website](http://nodeschool.io/host.html):
> NodeSchool is a fully community driven effort and is 100% open source. This means that anyone can use the NodeSchool materials and/or host an event.
>
> The only expectations for event hosts is that events be not-for-profit (free or low cost) and that governance of events should have an open membership model (so that nobody can 'control' the events)

This document lays out the parameters for the Dallas chapter's organizing team to bring an event to your company/organization/backyard.  The materials are all open source and nothing prevents you from using them. You are always free to host an event on your own, without the Dallas team's help or access to our meetup group.

If you feel we have violated the spirit of Nodeschool's requirements or open source ethos please [create an issue](https://github.com/nodeschool/dallas/issues).

### Host Benefits
We have cheekily defined levels of hosting/sponsorhip along the Higher Education theme of Nodeschool.

#### Undergraduate Level
- Brief intro / plug at the beginning of the night (made by an organizer or by your representative)
- Listed and thanked as sponsor on the meetup event page, github event [meeting notes](https://github.com/nodeschool/dallas/tree/gh-pages/events) (text only)

#### Graduate Level
- All of the Undergrad benefits
- Add your branding / logo to sponsor section
- Brief message from you in the sponsor section of the meetup event and github meeting notes (can include links)
- Brief message from you in the meetup announcement email to all members.

### Host requirements
In order to provide a great meetup environment that our membership is accustomed to hosts must agree to provide the following:

#### Undergraduate Level
- A room with
 -  WiFi
  - Chairs
  - Air-conditioning / heating (ensure your building manager doesn't automatically turn it off in the evenings)
  - Projector
  - Power outlets (remember every attendee will have a lap top)
- Food approved by organizers
- Soft drinks & water
- Serving products (plates, cups, napkins)
- Company swag (ie stickers) to hand out to workshop finishers.

 - We can help provide design ideas

- Beer or other premium drinks
 - Note that drunkenness is not tolerated.
- 2" hex sticker of your design or pay us to order generic ones with your name and colors
