## Tonight's featured workshoppers

- [javascripting](https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting)
- [learnyounode](https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode)

## Install node and tonight's workshoppers

Installation instructions for node and tonight's featured workshoppers are available on the TV in each conference room.

## Workshopper?

- Workshoppers are self guided sets of exercises that teach you an aspect
  of Javascript and node.
- Run the workshopper module to select an exercise. The instructions for
  that exercise will be printed out.
- Each exercise asks you to write some Javascript and verify your
  answer like so `javascripting verify my-solution.js`.
- If your solution passes, you are rewarded with lots of happy green
  text! If not, don't let the angry red text get you down. This stuff is
  tricky.

## While doing the workshoppers

- Don't hesitate to ask a friendly neighbor or one of the organizers for
  help if you get stuck.
- Nonverbal? Use the [gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/nodeschool/dallas)
  to chat it up and ask questions.
- Feel free to work on your own or if you're feeling
  [eXtreme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming), find a
  friend and work in pairs.
- For each exercise you finish, throw your hands in the air like you
  don't care and let out a hey-o/whoop/opa/holla/etc of success!
